# Comparative-Genomic-Alignment-of-Coding-vs-Non-Coding-Regions
This project performs comparative genomic analysis of coding and non-coding regions. Sequences are retrieved from NCBI, aligned using ClustalW, and analyzed for GC content distribution and conservation patterns. The pipeline highlights functional constraints on coding regions versus variability in non-coding sequences.
